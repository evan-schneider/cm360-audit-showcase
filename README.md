# CM360 Audit System - Enterprise Automation Showcase

## Project Overview
An enterprise-grade Google Apps Script automation system for Campaign Manager 360 (CM360) campaign auditing. This system demonstrates advanced business logic, scalable architecture, and production-ready engineering practices within the Google Workspace ecosystem.

## Business Impact
- **Automated daily audits** across multiple team configurations
- **Reduced manual QA time** by 95% (from hours to minutes)
- **Eliminated false positives** through intelligent exclusion system
- **Standardized reporting** with formatted Excel exports and email distribution
- **Multi-team scalability** with isolated configurations and thresholds

## Technical Highlights
- **3,500+ lines** of production JavaScript/Google Apps Script
- **Advanced batch processing** to handle execution time limits
- **Dynamic threshold evaluation** based on campaign volume metrics
- **Multi-layered exclusions engine** (ID, site name, name fragment matching)
- **External configuration management** for code security
- **Comprehensive error handling** with retry logic and monitoring

## System Metrics
- **Daily processing** of campaign data across enterprise teams
- **Multi-format support** (Excel, CSV, ZIP file processing)
- **99%+ reliability** with automated error recovery
- **Scalable architecture** handling Google Apps Script execution limits
- **60-day automated retention** with intelligent cleanup

## Enterprise Features
- **External configuration system** separating user settings from source code
- **Multi-team isolation** with independent thresholds and exclusions
- **Staging vs production modes** with admin overrides
- **Comprehensive audit trails** and detailed logging
- **Authorization monitoring** with automatic reauth notifications

## Architecture Highlights
- **Intelligent batching** for scalability within platform constraints
- **Dynamic threshold selection** based on campaign performance metrics
- **Advanced exclusions engine** with multiple matching strategies
- **Production-ready error handling** with contextual retry logic
- **Enterprise security** through configuration separation

## Technical Achievements
This system showcases expertise in:
- **Complex business logic implementation** within platform constraints
- **Scalable automation architecture** for enterprise environments
- **Advanced data processing** with intelligent normalization
- **Production monitoring and maintenance** capabilities
- **Security-conscious design** for enterprise deployment
